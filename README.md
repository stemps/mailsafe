# Mailsafe

Safe emailing for Rails. Prevents you from sending emails to real customers from non-production environments. You can choose to either re-route all emails to a single developer account or allow only recipients of your own domain.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mailsafe'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

You can re-route all emails to your developer email account by adding this your _development.rb_ file

```ruby
Mailsafe.setup do |config|
  config.override_receiver = "developer@devco.com"
end
```

The email subjects will be delivered to your account and prefixed with the original receiver in square brackets.


You can send emails to the intended recipients but only to a whitelist of receipient domains (e.g. helpful for a staging environment where you want to send emails to your company's and your client's domain)

```ruby
Mailsafe.setup do |config|
  config.allowed_domain = "devco.com, clientco.com"
end
```

If you are running multiple environments with _mailsafe_ it can help to know which environment an email came from. You can have _mailsafe_ prefix the subject line with _[environment name]_ 

```ruby
config.prefix_email_subject_with_rails_env = true
```


## Caveat

In order to filter (as in not send) emails I had to monkey patch the Mail#deliver method. If this makes you feel uneasy, better try out a different solution.
